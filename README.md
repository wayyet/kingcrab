## Why This Project Exists

Most agent stacks still assume Python- or Node-first runtimes. That works until you want to keep the rest of your system in .NET, publish lean self-contained binaries, or reuse existing infrastructure without rebuilding your runtime assumptions around another language stack.

OpenClaw.NET takes a different path:

- .NET-first gateway and agent runtime with a real NativeAOT-friendly deployment lane
- practical reuse of OpenClaw JS/TS plugins through a JSON-RPC bridge instead of forcing rewrites
- explicit compatibility diagnostics instead of vague "mostly compatible" claims
- an optional Microsoft Agent Framework orchestrator path in the MAF-enabled artifacts while keeping the native runtime as the default
- a platform for production-oriented agent infrastructure in .NET: auth, policy, memory, channels, observability, and packaged deployment targets

If this repo is useful to you, star it.

## What The Codebase Includes Today

- Gateway surfaces for HTTP, WebSocket, browser UI, webhooks, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Agent runtime for tools, memory, sessions, skills, policy, approvals, and message pipeline execution
- Two runtime lanes: trim-safe `aot` and broader-compatibility `jit`
- Two artifact families: standard artifacts plus MAF-enabled artifacts where `Runtime.Orchestrator=maf` is optional
- Built-in clients: browser UI at `/chat`, CLI, and Avalonia desktop companion
- Reusable library packages in-repo: `OpenClaw.Core`, `OpenClaw.PluginKit`, and `OpenClaw.SemanticKernelAdapter`
- Optional integrations for Telegram, Twilio SMS, WhatsApp, Semantic Kernel, the JS/TS plugin bridge, and the MAF adapter

## Ecosystem Compatibility

OpenClaw.NET is focused on **practical compatibility**, especially around tools, skills, and the mainstream plugin path.

| Surface | Status on `main` after this merge | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone `SKILL.md` packages | Supported | Run natively; no JS bridge required. |
| JS/TS tool plugins | Supported | Run through the Node bridge. |
| Trim-safe compatibility lane | Supported in `aot` | Conservative deployment path. |
| `registerChannel()` / `registerCommand()` / `registerProvider()` / `api.on(...)` | Supported in `jit` | Dynamic plugin surfaces are intentionally JIT-only. |
| `Runtime.Orchestrator=maf` | Supported in MAF-enabled artifacts | `native` remains the default orchestrator everywhere. |
| Unsupported plugin/runtime capabilities | Rejected explicitly | The gateway fails fast with compatibility diagnostics instead of partially loading the plugin. |

The goal is not full upstream extension-host parity. The goal is a clear, dependable compatibility contract with honest failure modes.

For the exact compatibility matrix, see [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Runtime Model

OpenClaw.NET now has two related selectors:

- `Runtime.Mode`: `aot`, `jit`, or `auto`
- `Runtime.Orchestrator`: `native` everywhere, or `maf` only in the MAF-enabled artifacts

In practice:

- `aot` keeps the trim-safe, lower-memory lane
- `jit` enables the broader dynamic/plugin compatibility lane
- `auto` chooses between `aot` and `jit` based on runtime capabilities
- `native` remains the default orchestrator even in MAF-enabled artifacts

## Optional Sandbox Execution

OpenClaw.NET can optionally route high-risk native tools through [OpenSandbox](https://github.com/AIDotNet/OpenSandbox) instead of executing them on the gateway host.

Current scope:

- `shell`
- `code_exec`
- `browser`

Key points:

- sandbox routing is enabled by default in the shipped gateway config
- the standard runtime artifact does not include the OpenSandbox integration package
- the sandbox-enabled build is produced with `-p:OpenClawEnableOpenSandbox=true`
- `Prefer` mode falls back to local execution if the provider is unavailable
- `Require` mode fails closed and is the recommended public-bind setting for `shell`
- set `OpenClaw:Sandbox:Provider=None` to force all sandbox-capable tools back to local execution

Example:

```json
"OpenClaw": {
  "Sandbox": {
    "Provider": "OpenSandbox",
    "Endpoint": "http://localhost:5000",
    "ApiKey": "env:OPEN_SANDBOX_API_KEY",
    "DefaultTTL": 300,
    "Tools": {
      "shell": {
        "Mode": "Prefer",
        "Template": "alpine:3.20",
        "TTL": 300
      },
      "code_exec": {
        "Mode": "Prefer",
        "Template": "nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.12-nodejs22-slim",
        "TTL": 300
      },
      "browser": {
        "Mode": "Prefer",
        "Template": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.52.0-noble",
        "TTL": 600
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These are starter image choices. For public or production deployments, promote tools like `shell` to `Require` and replace the image URIs with images you control.

## Architecture

OpenClaw.NET separates gateway startup and runtime composition into explicit layers instead of a single startup path.

Startup flow:

1. `Bootstrap/`
  - Loads config, resolves runtime mode and orchestrator, applies validation and hardening, and handles early exits such as `--doctor`.
2. `Composition/` and `Profiles/`
  - Registers services and applies the effective runtime lane: `aot` for trim-safe deployments or `jit` for expanded compatibility.
3. `Pipeline/` and `Endpoints/`
  - Wires middleware, channel startup, workers, shutdown handling, and the grouped HTTP/WebSocket surfaces.

Runtime flow:

- The Gateway handles HTTP, WebSocket, webhook, auth, policy, and observability concerns.
- The Agent Runtime owns reasoning, tool execution, memory interaction, and skill loading.
- Native tools run in-process.
- JS/TS plugins run through the Node.js bridge, with capability enforcement depending on the effective runtime lane.
- The optional MAF adapter swaps orchestration strategy inside the MAF-enabled artifacts; it does not replace the gateway/runtime ownership model.
- Pure `SKILL.md` packages remain independent of the plugin bridge.

   end
```

Runtime lanes:

- `OpenClaw:Runtime:Mode="aot"` keeps the trim-safe, low-memory lane.
- `OpenClaw:Runtime:Mode="jit"` enables expanded bridge surfaces and native dynamic plugins.
- `OpenClaw:Runtime:Mode="auto"` selects `jit` when dynamic code is available and `aot` otherwise.

For the full startup-module breakdown, see [docs/architecture-startup-refactor.md](docs/architecture-startup-refactor.md).

## Quickstart (local)

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the fastest path from zero to a running gateway.

The shortest local path is:

1. Set your API key:
  - `export MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY="..."`
  - Optional workspace: `export OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE="$PWD/workspace"`
  - Optional runtime selection: `export OpenClaw__Runtime__Mode="jit"`
2. Run the gateway:
  - `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Gateway -c Release`
  - Or validate config first: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Gateway -c Release -- --doctor`
  - Optional config file: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Gateway -c Release -- --config ~/.openclaw/config.json`
3. Use one of the built-in clients:
  - Web UI: `http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat`
  - WebSocket endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789/ws`
  - CLI: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -c Release -- chat`
  - Companion app: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Companion -c Release`

Environment variables for the CLI:

- `OPENCLAW_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:18789`)
- `OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN` (only required when the gateway enforces auth)

For advanced provider setup, webhook channels, and deployment hardening, see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) and [Security Guide](SECURITY.md).

## Usage

Common local usage paths:

- Browser UI: start the gateway and open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat`
- CLI chat: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -c Release -- chat`
- One-shot CLI run: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -c Release -- run "summarize this README" --file ./README.md`
- Desktop companion: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Companion -c Release`
- Doctor/report mode: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Gateway -c Release -- --doctor`

Common runtime choices:

- Use `aot` when you want the trim-safe mainstream lane.
- Use `jit` when you need expanded plugin compatibility or native dynamic plugins.
- Leave `auto` if you want the artifact to choose based on dynamic-code support.

The most practical local setup is:

- Web UI or Companion for interactive usage
- CLI for scripting and automation
- `--doctor` before exposing a public bind or enabling plugins

## Companion app (Avalonia)

Run the cross-platform desktop companion:
- `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Companion -c Release`

Notes:
- For non-loopback binds, set `OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN` on the gateway and enter the same token in the companion app.
- If you enable “Remember”, the token is saved to `settings.json` under your OS application data directory.

## WebSocket protocol

The gateway supports **both**:

### Raw text (legacy)
- Client sends: raw UTF-8 text
- Server replies: raw UTF-8 text

### JSON envelope (opt-in)
If the client sends JSON shaped like this, the gateway replies with JSON:

Client → Server:
```json
{ "type": "user_message", "text": "hello", "messageId": "optional", "replyToMessageId": "optional" }
```

Server → Client:
```json
{ "type": "assistant_message", "text": "hi", "inReplyToMessageId": "optional" }
```

## Internet-ready deployment

### Authentication (required for non-loopback bind)
If `OpenClaw:BindAddress` is not loopback (e.g. `0.0.0.0`), you **must** set `OpenClaw:AuthToken` / `OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Preferred client auth:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Optional legacy auth (disabled by default):
- `?token=<token>` when `OpenClaw:Security:AllowQueryStringToken=true`

Built-in WebChat auth behavior:
- The `/chat` UI connects to `/ws` using `?token=<token>` from the Auth Token field.
- For Internet-facing/non-loopback binds, set `OpenClaw:Security:AllowQueryStringToken=true` if you use the built-in WebChat.
- Tokens are stored in `sessionStorage` by default. Enabling **Remember** also stores `openclaw_token` in `localStorage`.

### TLS
You can run TLS either:
- Behind a reverse proxy (recommended): nginx / Caddy / Cloudflare, forwarding to `http://127.0.0.1:18789`
- Directly in Kestrel: configure HTTPS endpoints/certs via standard ASP.NET Core configuration

If you enable `OpenClaw:Security:TrustForwardedHeaders=true`, set `OpenClaw:Security:KnownProxies` to the IPs of your reverse proxies.

### Hardened public-bind defaults
When binding to a non-loopback address, the gateway **refuses to start** unless you explicitly harden (or opt in to) the most dangerous settings:
- Wildcard tooling roots (`AllowedReadRoots=["*"]`, `AllowedWriteRoots=["*"]`)
- `OpenClaw:Tooling:AllowShell=true`
- `OpenClaw:Plugins:Enabled=true` or `OpenClaw:Plugins:DynamicNative:Enabled=true` (third-party plugin execution)
- WhatsApp official webhooks without signature validation (`ValidateSignature=true` + `WebhookAppSecretRef` required)
- WhatsApp bridge webhooks without a bridge token (`BridgeTokenRef` / `BridgeToken` required)
- `raw:` secret refs (to reduce accidental secret commits)

To override (not recommended), set:
- `OpenClaw:Security:AllowUnsafeToolingOnPublicBind=true`
- `OpenClaw:Security:AllowPluginBridgeOnPublicBind=true`
- `OpenClaw:Security:AllowRawSecretRefsOnPublicBind=true`

### Tooling warning
This project includes local tools (`shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`). If you expose the gateway publicly, strongly consider restricting:
- `OpenClaw:Tooling:AllowShell=false`
- `OpenClaw:Tooling:AllowedReadRoots` / `AllowedWriteRoots` to specific directories

### WebSocket origin
If you are connecting from a browser-based client hosted on a different origin, configure:
- `OpenClaw:Security:AllowedOrigins=["https://your-ui-host"]`

If `AllowedOrigins` is not configured and the client sends an `Origin` header, the gateway requires same-origin.

## Plugin Ecosystem Compatibility 🔌

OpenClaw.NET now exposes two explicit runtime lanes:

- `OpenClaw:Runtime:Mode="aot"` keeps the low-memory, trim-safe lane. Supported plugin capabilities here are `registerTool()`, `registerService()`, plugin-packaged skills, and the supported manifest/config subset.
- `OpenClaw:Runtime:Mode="jit"` enables the expanded compatibility lane. In this mode the bridge also supports `registerChannel()`, `registerCommand()`, `registerProvider()`, and `api.on(...)`, and the gateway can load JIT-only in-process native dynamic plugins.

Pure ClawHub `SKILL.md` packages are independent of the bridge and remain the most plug-and-play compatibility path.

When you enable `OpenClaw:Plugins:Enabled=true`, the Gateway spawns a Node.js JSON-RPC bridge. When you enable `OpenClaw:Plugins:DynamicNative:Enabled=true`, the gateway also loads JIT-only in-process .NET plugins through the native dynamic host.

Across both lanes, unsupported surfaces fail fast with explicit diagnostics instead of silently degrading:

- `registerGatewayMethod()`
- `registerCli()`
- any JIT-only capability when the effective runtime mode is `aot`

The `/doctor` report includes per-plugin load diagnostics, and the repo now includes hermetic bridge tests plus a pinned public smoke manifest for mainstream packages. For the exact matrix and TypeScript requirements such as `jiti`, see **[Plugin Compatibility Guide](COMPATIBILITY.md)**.

## Semantic Kernel interop (optional)

OpenClaw.NET is not a replacement for Semantic Kernel. If you're already using `Microsoft.SemanticKernel`, OpenClaw can act as the **production gateway/runtime host** (auth, rate limits, channels, OTEL, policy) around your SK code.

Supported integration patterns today:
- **Wrap your SK orchestration as an OpenClaw tool**: keep SK in-process, expose a single "entrypoint" tool the OpenClaw agent can call.
- **Host SK-based agents behind the OpenClaw gateway**: use OpenClaw for Internet-facing concerns (WebSocket, `/v1/*`, Telegram/Twilio/WhatsApp), while your SK logic stays in your app/tool layer.

More details and AOT/trimming notes: see `SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md`.

Conceptual example (tool wrapper):
```csharp
// Your tool can instantiate and call Semantic Kernel. OpenClaw policies still apply
// to *when* this tool runs, who can call it, and how often.
public sealed class SemanticKernelTool : ITool
{
    public string Name => "sk_example";
    public string Description => "Example SK-backed tool.";
    public string ParameterSchema => "{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"text\":{\"type\":\"string\"}},\"required\":[\"text\"]}";

    public async ValueTask<string> ExecuteAsync(string argumentsJson, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Parse argsJson, then run SK here (Kernel builder + plugin invocation).
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

Notes:
- **NativeAOT**: Semantic Kernel usage may require additional trimming/reflection configuration. Keep SK interop optional so the core gateway/runtime remains NativeAOT-friendly.

Available:
- `src/OpenClaw.SemanticKernelAdapter` — optional adapter library that exposes SK functions as OpenClaw tools.
- `samples/OpenClaw.SemanticKernelInteropHost` — runnable sample host demonstrating `/v1/responses` without requiring external LLM access.

## Telegram Webhook channel

### Setup
1. Create a Telegram Bot via BotFather and obtain the Bot Token.
2. Set the auth token as an environment variable:
   - `export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..."`
3. Configure `OpenClaw:Channels:Telegram` in `src/OpenClaw.Gateway/appsettings.json`:
   - `Enabled=true`
   - `BotTokenRef="env:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"`
   - `MaxRequestBytes=65536` (default; inbound webhook body cap)

### Webhook
Register your public webhook URL directly with Telegram's API:
- `POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-token>/setWebhook?url=https://<your-public-host>/telegram/inbound`

Notes:
- The inbound webhook path is configurable via `OpenClaw:Channels:Telegram:WebhookPath` (default: `/telegram/inbound`).
- `AllowedFromUserIds` currently checks the numeric `chat.id` value from Telegram updates (not the `from.id` user id).

## Twilio SMS channel

### Setup
1. Create a Twilio Messaging Service (recommended) or buy a Twilio phone number.
2. Set the auth token as an environment variable:
   - `export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."`
3. Configure `OpenClaw:Channels:Sms:Twilio` in `src/OpenClaw.Gateway/appsettings.json`:
   - `Enabled=true`
   - `AccountSid=...`
   - `AuthTokenRef="env:TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"`
   - `MessagingServiceSid=...` (preferred) or `FromNumber="+1..."` (fallback)
   - `AllowedFromNumbers=[ "+1YOUR_MOBILE" ]`
   - `AllowedToNumbers=[ "+1YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER" ]`
   - `WebhookPublicBaseUrl="https://<your-public-host>"` (required when `ValidateSignature=true`)
   - `MaxRequestBytes=65536` (default; inbound webhook body cap)

### Webhook
Point Twilio’s inbound SMS webhook to:
- `POST https://<your-public-host>/twilio/sms/inbound`

Recommended exposure options:
- Reverse proxy with TLS
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- Tailscale funnel / reverse proxy

### Security checklist
- Keep `ValidateSignature=true`
- Use strict allowlists (`AllowedFromNumbers`, `AllowedToNumbers`)
- Do not set `AuthTokenRef` to `raw:...` outside local development

## Webhook body limits

Inbound webhook payloads are hard-capped before parsing. Configure these limits as needed:

- `OpenClaw:Channels:Sms:Twilio:MaxRequestBytes` (default `65536`)
- `OpenClaw:Channels:Telegram:MaxRequestBytes` (default `65536`)
- `OpenClaw:Channels:WhatsApp:MaxRequestBytes` (default `65536`)
- `OpenClaw:Webhooks:Endpoints:<name>:MaxRequestBytes` (default `131072`)

For generic `/webhooks/{name}` endpoints, `MaxBodyLength` still controls prompt truncation after request-size validation.
If `ValidateHmac=true`, `Secret` is required; startup validation fails otherwise.

## Docker deployment

### Quick start
1. Set required environment variables:

**Bash / Zsh:**
```bash
export MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY = "sk-..."
$env:OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN = [Convert]::ToHexString((1..32 | Array { Get-Random -Min 0 -Max 256 }))
$env:EMAIL_PASSWORD = "..." # (Optional) For email tool
```

> **Note**: For the built-in WebChat UI (`http://<ip>:18789/chat`), enter this exact `OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN` value in the "Auth Token" field. WebChat connects with a query token (`?token=`), so on non-loopback binds you must also set `OpenClaw:Security:AllowQueryStringToken=true`. Tokens are session-scoped by default; check **Remember** to persist across browser restarts. If you enable the **Email Tool**, set `EMAIL_PASSWORD` similarly.

# 2. Run (gateway only)
docker compose up -d openclaw

# 3. Run with automatic TLS via Caddy
export OPENCLAW_DOMAIN="openclaw.example.com"
docker compose --profile with-tls up -d
```

### Build from source
```bash
docker build -t openclaw.net .
docker run -d -p 18789:18789 \
  -e MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY="sk-..." \
  -e OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN="change-me" \
  -v openclaw-memory:/app/memory \
  openclaw.net
```

### Optional MAF backend

OpenClaw ships with `native` as the default orchestrator. Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) is supported as an optional backend only in the MAF-enabled build artifacts.

Runtime selection:

```json
{
  "OpenClaw": {
    "Runtime": {
      "Mode": "auto|jit|aot",
      "Orchestrator": "native|maf"
    }
  }
}
```

- Standard artifacts support `Runtime.Orchestrator=native` only and fail fast if `maf` is configured.
- MAF-enabled artifacts support both `native` and `maf`.
- `Runtime.Mode=auto` behavior is unchanged.
- `native` remains the default even in MAF-enabled artifacts.

Publish the supported artifact set with:

```bash
bash eng/publish-gateway-artifacts.sh
```

This produces:

- `artifacts/releases/gateway-standard-jit`
- `artifacts/releases/gateway-maf-enabled-jit`
- `artifacts/releases/gateway-standard-aot`
- `artifacts/releases/gateway-maf-enabled-aot`

MAF is still a prerelease dependency, so the MAF-enabled artifacts should be versioned and rolled out deliberately even though the backend is feature-complete in this repository.

### Published images

The same multi-arch image is published to:

- `ghcr.io/clawdotnet/openclaw.net:latest`
- `tellikoroma/openclaw.net:latest`
- `public.ecr.aws/u6i5b9b7/openclaw.net:latest`

Example pull:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/clawdotnet/openclaw.net:latest
```

### Push to a registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, or ECR Public)
Multi-arch push (recommended):
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t ghcr.io/clawdotnet/openclaw.net:latest \
  -t ghcr.io/clawdotnet/openclaw.net:<version> \
  -t tellikoroma/openclaw.net:latest \
  -t tellikoroma/openclaw.net:<version> \
  -t public.ecr.aws/u6i5b9b7/openclaw.net:latest \
  -t public.ecr.aws/u6i5b9b7/openclaw.net:<version> \
  --push .
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build:
1. **Build stage** — full .NET SDK, runs tests, publishes NativeAOT binary
2. **Runtime stage** — Ubuntu Chiseled (distroless), ~23 MB NativeAOT binary, non-root user

### Volumes
| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/app/memory` | Session history + memory notes (persist across restarts) |
| `/app/workspace` | Mounted workspace for file tools (optional) |

## Production hardening checklist

- [ ] Set `OPENCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN` to a strong random value
- [ ] Set `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY` via environment variable (never in config files)
- [ ] Use `appsettings.Production.json` (`AllowShell=false`, restricted roots)
- [ ] Enable TLS (reverse proxy or Kestrel HTTPS)
- [ ] Set `AllowedOrigins` if serving a web frontend
- [ ] Set `TrustForwardedHeaders=true` + `KnownProxies` if behind a proxy
- [ ] Set `MaxConnectionsPerIp` and `MessagesPerMinutePerConnection` for rate limiting
- [ ] Set `OpenClaw:SessionRateLimitPerMinute` to rate limit inbound messages (also applies to `/v1/*` OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
- [ ] Monitor `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints
- [ ] Pin a specific Docker image tag (not `:latest`) in production

## TLS options

### Option 1: Caddy reverse proxy (recommended)
The included `docker-compose.yml` has a Caddy service with automatic HTTPS:
```bash
export OPENCLAW_DOMAIN="openclaw.example.com"
docker compose --profile with-tls up -d
```
Caddy auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certificates. Edit `deploy/Caddyfile` to customize.

If you want the gateway to trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers from your proxy, set:
- `OpenClaw__Security__TrustForwardedHeaders=true`
- `OpenClaw__Security__KnownProxies__0=<your-proxy-ip>`

### Option 2: nginx reverse proxy
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name openclaw.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/openclaw.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/openclaw.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Kestrel HTTPS (no reverse proxy)
Configure directly in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://0.0.0.0:443",
        "Certificate": {
          "Path": "/certs/cert.pfx",
          "Password": "env:CERT_PASSWORD"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Memory retention (opt-in)

OpenClaw now supports a background retention sweeper for persisted **sessions + branches**.
- Default is off: `OpenClaw:Memory:Retention:Enabled=false`
- Expired items are archived as raw JSON before delete
- Default TTLs: sessions `30` days, branches `14` days
- Default archive retention: `30` days

Example config:
```json
{
  "OpenClaw": {
    "Memory": {
      "Retention": {
        "Enabled": true,
        "RunOnStartup": true,
        "SweepIntervalMinutes": 30,
        "SessionTtlDays": 30,
        "BranchTtlDays": 14,
        "ArchiveEnabled": true,
        "ArchivePath": "./memory/archive",
        "ArchiveRetentionDays": 30,
        "MaxItemsPerSweep": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Recommended rollout:
1. Run a dry-run first: `POST /memory/retention/sweep?dryRun=true`
2. Review `GET /memory/retention/status` and `/doctor/text`
3. Confirm archive path sizing and filesystem permissions

Compaction remains disabled by default. If enabling compaction, `CompactionThreshold` must be greater than `MaxHistoryTurns`.

### Observability & Distributed Tracing

OpenClaw natively integrates with **OpenTelemetry**, providing deep insights into agent reasoning, tool execution, and session lifecycles.

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Token (if non-loopback) | Basic health check (`{ status, uptime }`) |
| `GET /metrics` | Token (if non-loopback) | Runtime counters (requests, tokens, tool calls, circuit breaker state, retention runs/outcomes) |
| `GET /memory/retention/status` | Token (if non-loopback) | Retention config + last run state + persisted session/branch counts |
| `POST /memory/retention/sweep?dryRun=true|false` | Token (if non-loopback) | Trigger an immediate retention sweep (manual admin action) |

### Structured logging
All agent operations emit structured logs and `.NET Activity` traces with correlation IDs. You can export these to OTLP collectors like Jaeger, Prometheus, or Grafana:
```
[abc123def456] Turn start session=ws:user1 channel=websocket
[abc123def456] Tool browser completed in 1250ms ok=True
[abc123def456] Turn complete: Turn[abc123def456] session=ws:user1 llm=2 retries=0 tokens=150in/80out tools=1
```

Set log levels in config:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "AgentRuntime": "Debug",
      "SessionManager": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
- **On push/PR to main**: build + test both the standard and MAF-enabled gateway/test targets
- **On push to main**: publish and upload `gateway-standard-{jit|aot}` plus `gateway-maf-enabled-{jit|aot}` gateway artifacts
- **On push to main**: publish NativeAOT CLI artifact + Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
